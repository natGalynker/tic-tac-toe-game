My Tic TAC TOE
[Tic Tac Toe Repo](https://github.com/natGalynker/tic-tac-toe-game)
A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
I create a rough draft by hand of what I saw the app/site looking
like at various stages both on a mobil device and on a desktop.
-   The data structure you plan to use. I will be using arrays will be how
data is stored. This will make most sense since arrays can hold both numbers
abd string values.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS. I will
use data attributes to connect the html elements with the javascript. This way I
can just get their value by using the data method .In HTML but the data (logic)
will be handled by AJAX. But sent as JSON.
-   How you plan to approach this project. I want to tackle a little bit everyday
even if it is just an hour or so. Small progress steps, then testing, then commit
and repeate. I want to not jump leaps and steps ahead and do so in a cohessive
logical manner. I want to do little steps at a time and not tackle one huge pile
in one language only for it to not cooperate with the HTMl/JS/CSS that works
with it, which will cause unnecessary work.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
-   As a user I want a visual login/signup button, so I don't get frustrated
-   As a user, I want to create an account start the game
-   As a user, I want to know what player I am so I can plan my moves
-   As a user, I want to choose my icon, so that its creative/personal
-   As a user, I want to be able to track my score, so I can see my progress
-   As a user, I want the winner to be displayed, so I know the game is over
-   As a user I want the option of round 2, so that I can resume the game
-   As a user, I want the logout/end session button visable, so that I can quit whenever


-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
Putting al the JS files in the scripts directory. There would be different JS
file which would handle different functions. One would handle all the ajax calls,
one which would handle the events such as submitting forms or anything which would
require an event handler. There would be a file which would manage the verification
of the event handlers. I would make sure that circular dependecy would not happen
by doint so.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project. I would like to really utilize
SASS. I have used bootstrap before but I have heard really great things about SASS
SAST and am excited to try it. I would like to
-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
I would create separate branches for HTML, CSS, and JS at the very least. I would
commit as often as I can, ideally after verifying that the functionality of a
submit or other action was indeed working. I would not want to commit only once
a day or once every few hours because that would make taking a step back much more
problamatic than helpful.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses. I would like to. I want to first
get my code working well completed on its own before attempting the bonuses.
these are the bonuses that appeal to me and which I would like to attempt:
Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter.
Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc).
Get inventive with your styling.
